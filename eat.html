                            <br> Small and discreet restaurant in the relatively modest Italian town of Modena by chef Massimo
                            Bottura. Delivers one of the very finest dining experiences in the world, combining nods to tradition
                            with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with daring.Bottura
                            weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the surrounding
                            Emilia-Romagna region.
                            <br>
                            <br>Courses include the now-famous (and equally delicious) Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano, which
                            takes the diner through the region’s esteemed cheese in different temperatures, textures and
                            tastes, as well as Adriatic Chowder. The latter takes the form of pie crust ‘pirate ship’ filled
                            with sea snails, razor clams, blue lobster and truffle clam chowder as a representation of travel,
                            seasonality and the local coastline.
                            <br>
                            <br> The kitchen’s creations are heavily influenced by art and music (in particular, jazz), and the
                            dining space is made up of three elegant rooms that are adorned with high-quality contemporary

                            <br>
                            <br> El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically talented
                            brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet.Sit down at your table in
                            the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as centrepiece.
                            Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish: Joan,
                            the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef.
                            <br>
                            <br> Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a restaurant
                            in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer creative
                            force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking techniques
                            and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing, which
                            enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own.
                            <br>
                            <br> Highlights dishes include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree that explode
                            with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized interpretations
                            of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’.

                            Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded cove
                            perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive an
                            hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes imbued
                            with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients.
                            <br>
                            <br>Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing additional
                            products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich in
                            both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on fried
                            anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s signature:
                            oyster with tapioca, shallot cream, and pear

                            working in kitchens at age 14, and earned his first Michelin star at 24. He became executive
                            chef at Eleven Madison Park in 2006 when the restaurant was owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square
                            Hospitality Group. In 2011, he became co-owner with the charismatic Will Guidara, who runs the

                            Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt blue
                            mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that presides
                            over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional lounge

                            <strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, testament
                            to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El Bulli-influenced
                            chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of which
                            are eaten with the hands.
                            <br>
                            <br>With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved from purely
                            modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence from
                            restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites, Japanese-Indian
                            nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the menu
                            alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a flavoursome
                            curry straight from the plate.
                            <br>
                            <br>While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer, as Anand
                            has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes from
                            all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in Fukuoka,
                            Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de la
                            Nature Goh.

                            <br>
                            <br>Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is
                            Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team
                            have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting
                            and unique produce from land, sea and mountains.
                            <br>
                            <br>Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure
                            products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme
                            Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire,
                            sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level
                            to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.
